## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: `SquareShooter`

**Purpose**: `A game where the player shoots neverending enemies that get more numerous and difficult as time progresses. At least originally.`

**Source Assignment(s)**: `Breath of Tuna`

**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:
  
image/playerCRC.png
image/projectileCRC.png

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. ðŸ™ƒ

Reflect on what youâ€™ve done so far. Howâ€™s it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    Well, there's a minimum viable product that works, but it's simple to the point of embarassement.
    Waiting until the last possible moment leads to widespread feature cuts.
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

**Completion Percentage**: `50%`

**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    Strategy: all-nighter
    chance of success: questionable
```

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### User Instructions
Move "ship" up and down using the UP and DOWN arrow keys, and shoot with the spacebar. That's it.

### Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
  - 
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
  - keeping track of the bullets; watching a tutorial provided a solution
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
  - start earlier
